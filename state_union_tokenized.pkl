VPRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION\u000a \u000aJanuary 31, 2006\u000a\u000aTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all.
p1
aVMr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream.
p2
aVTonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King.
p3
aV(Applause.)

p6
aVWhite House photo by Eric DraperEvery time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege, and mindful of the history we've seen together.
p7
aVWe have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement.
p8
aVWe have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to serve with you.
p9
aVIn a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate.
p10
aVBut even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger.
p11
aVTo confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my part.
p12
aVTonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will make it stronger.
p13
aV(Applause.)
p14
aVIn this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country.
p15
aVWe will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life.
p16
aVWe will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.
p17
aVIn a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting -- yet it ends in danger and decline.
p18
aVThe only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership -- so the United States of America will continue to lead.
p19
aV(Applause.)
p20
aVAbroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal -- we seek the end of tyranny in our world.
p21
aVSome dismiss that goal as misguided idealism.
p22
aVIn reality, the future security of America depends on it.
p23
aVOn September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country.
p24
aVDictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction.
p25
aVDemocracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror.
p26
aVEvery step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer -- so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.
p27
aV(Applause.)
p28
aVFar from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time.
p29
aVIn 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world.
p30
aVToday, there are 122.
p31
aVAnd we're writing a new chapter in the story of self-government -- with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom.
p32
aVAt the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations.
p33
aVAnd we do not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran -- because the demands of justice, and the peace of this world, require their freedom, as well.
p34
aV(Applause.)
p35
aVPresident George W. Bush delivers his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan.
p36
aV31, 2006.
p37
aVWhite House photo by Eric Draper No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it.
p38
aVAnd one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam -- the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death.
p39
aVTerrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder -- and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously.
p40
aVThey seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East, and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder.
p41
aVTheir aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world.
p42
aVLacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear.
p43
aVWhen they murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth.
p44
aVBut they have miscalculated: We love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.
p45
aV(Applause.)
p46
aVIn a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders.
p47
aVIf we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone.
p48
aVThey would simply move the battlefield to our own shores.
p49
aVThere is no peace in retreat.
p50
aVAnd there is no honor in retreat.
p51
aVBy allowing radical Islam to work its will -- by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself -- we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even in our own courage.
p52
aVBut our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil.
p53
aV(Applause.)
p54
aVAmerica rejects the false comfort of isolationism.
p55
aVWe are the nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire.
p56
aVOnce again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace.
p57
aVWe remain on the offensive against terror networks.
p58
aVWe have killed or captured many of their leaders -- and for the others, their day will come.
p59
aVPresident George W. Bush greets members of Congress after his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan.
p60
aV31, 2006.
p61
aVWhite House photo by Eric Draper We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine President and a National Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy.
p62
aVWe're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory.
p63
aVFirst, we're helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized.
p64
aVSecond, we're continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom.
p65
aVAnd, third, we're striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy.
p66
aVIraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.
p67
aV(Applause.)
p68
aVOur work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal.
p69
aVBut that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy.
p70
aVIn less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections.
p71
aVAt the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces.
p72
aVI am confident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military.
p73
aVFellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning.
p74
aV(Applause.)
p75
aVThe road of victory is the road that will take our troops home.
p76
aVAs we make progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels -- but those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C.
p77
aV(Applause.)
p78
aVOur coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq.
p79
aVWe've adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction.
p80
aVAlong the way, we have benefitted from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of Congress of both parties.
p81
aVIn the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice.
p82
aVYet, there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure.
p83
aV(Applause.)
p84
aVHindsight alone is not wisdom, and second-guessing is not a strategy.
p85
aV(Applause.)
p86
aVWith so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor.
p87
aVA sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a pledge from America means little.
p88
aVMembers of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military in this vital mission.
p89
aV(Applause.)
p90
aVLaura Bush is applauded as she is introduced Tuesday evening, Jan.
p91
aV31, 2006 during the State of the Union Address at United States Capitol in Washington.
p92
aVWhite House photo by Eric Draper Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices -- and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear.
p93
aVThey know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb.
p94
aVAnd those who know the costs also know the stakes.
p95
aVMarine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fallujah.
p96
aVHe left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every American.
p97
aVHere is what Dan wrote: "I know what honor is.
p98
aV... It has been an honor to protect and serve all of you.
p99
aVI faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to....
p100
aVNever falter!
p101
aVDon't hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting."
p102
aVStaff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are with us this evening.
p103
aVWelcome.
p104
aV(Applause.)
p105
aVOur nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country.
p106
aVWe're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation's uniform -- and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's military families.
p107
aV(Applause.)
p108
aVOur offensive against terror involves more than military action.
p109
aVUltimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change.
p110
aVSo the United States of America supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East.
p111
aVElections are vital, but they are only the beginning.
p112
aVRaising up a democracy requires the rule of law, and protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote.
p113
aVThe great people of Egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election -- and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism.
p114
aVThe Palestinian people have voted in elections.
p115
aVAnd now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace.
p116
aV(Applause.)
p117
aVSaudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform -- now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts.
p118
aVDemocracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens.
p119
aVYet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity.
p120
aV(Applause.)
p121
aVPresident George W. Bush waves toward the upper visitors gallery of the House Chamber following his State of the Union remarks Tuesday, Jan.
p122
aV31, 2006 at the United States Capitol.
p123
aVWhite House photo by Eric Draper The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people.
p124
aVThe regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon -- and that must come to an end.
p125
aV(Applause.)
p126
aVThe Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons.
p127
aV(Applause.)
p128
aVAmerica will continue to rally the world to confront these threats.
p129
aVTonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you, and we respect your country.
p130
aVWe respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom.
p131
aVAnd our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.
p132
aV(Applause.)
p133
aVTo overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress, and fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands.
p134
aVIsolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need.
p135
aVWe show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into slavery.
p136
aVWe also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, and organized crime, and human trafficking, and the drug trade.
p137
aVIn recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform.
p138
aVFor people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life.
p139
aVShort-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country.
p140
aVI urge members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America.
p141
aVOur country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home.
p142
aVThe enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.
p143
aVFortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security.
p144
aVThese men and women are dedicating their lives, protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks.
p145
aV(Applause.)
p146
aVThey also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime -- so I ask you to reauthorize the Patriot Act.
p147
aV(Applause.)
p148
aVIt is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy.
p149
aVWe now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to al Qaeda operatives overseas.
p150
aVBut we did not know about their plans until it was too late.
p151
aVSo to prevent another attack -- based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from America.
p152
aVPrevious Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have, and federal courts have approved the use of that authority.
p153
aVAppropriate members of Congress have been kept informed.
p154
aVThe terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks.
p155
aVIt remains essential to the security of America.
p156
aVIf there are people inside our country who are talking with al Qaeda, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.
p157
aV(Applause.)
p158
aVIn all these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions -- we need the support of our friends and allies.
p159
aVTo draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act.
p160
aVThe only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world.
p161
aVYet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth.
p162
aVAmerican leaders -- from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan -- rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on the march.
p163
aVOur own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy -- a war that will be fought by Presidents of both parties, who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress.
p164
aVAnd tonight I ask for yours.
p165
aVTogether, let us protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom.
p166
aV(Applause.)
p167
aVHere at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world.
p168
aVOur economy is healthy and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations.
p169
aVIn the last two-and-a-half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the European Union combined.
p170
aV(Applause.)
p171
aVEven in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world.
p172
aVThe American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent.
p173
aVIn a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors, like China and India, and this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people's fears.
p174
aVSo we're seeing some old temptations return.
p175
aVProtectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy.
p176
aVOthers say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes.
p177
aVWe hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy -- even though this economy could not function without them.
p178
aV(Applause.)
p179
aVAll these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction -- toward a stagnant and second-rate economy.
p180
aVTonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence; an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs.
p181
aVAmericans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it.
p182
aVKeeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing.
p183
aVAnd our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend, save, and invest.
p184
aVIn the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses, and families -- and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth.
p185
aV(Applause.)
p186
aVYet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years.
p187
aVIf we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome.
p188
aVBecause America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief.
p189
aVI urge the Congress to act responsibly, and make the tax cuts permanent.
p190
aV(Applause.)
p191
aVKeeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars.
p192
aVEvery year of my presidency, we've reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending, and last year you passed bills that cut this spending.
p193
aVThis year my budget will cut it again, and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities.
p194
aVBy passing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billion next year, and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.
p195
aV(Applause.)
p196
aVI am pleased that members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because the federal budget has too many special interest projects.
p197
aV(Applause.)
p198
aVAnd we can tackle this problem together, if you pass the line-item veto.
p199
aV(Applause.)
p200
aVWe must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements.
p201
aVThis year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60, including two of my Dad's favorite people -- me and President Clinton.
p202
aV(Laughter.)
p203
aVThis milestone is more than a personal crisis -- (laughter) -- it is a national challenge.
p204
aVThe retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government.
p205
aVBy 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget.
p206
aVAnd that will present future Congresses with impossible choices -- staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending.
p207
aVCongress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security -- (applause) -- yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away.
p208
aV(Applause.)
p209
aVAnd every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse.
p210
aVSo tonight, I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
p211
aVThis commission should include members of Congress of both parties, and offer bipartisan solutions.
p212
aVWe need to put aside partisan politics and work together and get this problem solved.
p213
aV(Applause.)
p214
aVKeeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow.
p215
aVOne out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American.
p216
aVWith open markets and a level playing field, no one can out-produce or out-compete the American worker.
p217
aV(Applause.)
p218
aVKeeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy.
p219
aVOur nation needs orderly and secure borders.
p220
aV(Applause.)
p221
aVTo meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection.
p222
aV(Applause.)
p223
aVAnd we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime at the border.
p224
aV(Applause.)
p225
aVKeeping America competitive requires affordable health care.
p226
aV(Applause.)
p227
aVOur government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility.
p228
aV(Applause.)
p229
aVFor all Americans -- for all Americans, we must confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need.
p230
aV(Applause.)
p231
aVWe will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology, to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors.
p232
aVWe will strengthen health savings accounts -- making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get.
p233
aV(Applause.)
p234
aVWe will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance.
p235
aV(Applause.)
p236
aVAnd because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without a single OB/GYN -- I ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year.
p237
aV(Applause.)
p238
aVKeeping America competitive requires affordable energy.
p239
aVAnd here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.
p240
aVThe best way to break this addiction is through technology.
p241
aVSince 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources -- and we are on the threshold of incredible advances.
p242
aVSo tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative -- a 22-percent increase in clean-energy research -- at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas.
p243
aVTo change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants, revolutionary solar and wind technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy.
p244
aV(Applause.)
p245
aVWe must also change how we power our automobiles.
p246
aVWe will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen.
p247
aVWe'll also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn, but from wood chips and stalks, or switch grass.
p248
aVOur goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years.
p249
aV(Applause.)
p250
aVBreakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025.
p251
aV(Applause.)
p252
aVBy applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum-based economy, and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past.
p253
aV(Applause.)
p254
aVAnd to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity.
p255
aVOur greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitious people -- and we're going to keep that edge.
p256
aVTonight I announce an American Competitiveness Initiative, to encourage innovation throughout our economy, and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math and science.
p257
aV(Applause.)
p258
aVFirst, I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years.
p259
aVThis funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources.
p260
aVSecond, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit -- (applause) -- to encourage bolder private-sector initiatives in technology.
p261
aVWith more research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life -- and ensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come.
p262
aV(Applause.)
p263
aVThird, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations.
p264
aVWe've made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country.
p265
aVTonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs.
p266
aVIf we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world.
p267
aV(Applause.)
p268
aVPreparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share.
p269
aVI urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative, and together we will show the world what the American people can achieve.
p270
aVAmerica is a great force for freedom and prosperity.
p271
aVYet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another.
p272
aVSo we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.
p273
aVIn recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation.
p274
aVViolent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s.
p275
aVWelfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade.
p276
aVDrug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001.
p277
aVThere are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row.
p278
aV(Applause.)
p279
aVThese gains are evidence of a quiet transformation -- a revolution of conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment.
p280
aVGovernment has played a role.
p281
aVWise policies, such as welfare reform and drug education and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country.
p282
aVAnd everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record.
p283
aV(Applause.)
p284
aVYet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic institutions.
p285
aVThey're concerned about unethical conduct by public officials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage.
p286
aVThey worry about children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.
p287
aVAs we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that America is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel.
p288
aVThe American people know better than that.
p289
aVWe have proven the pessimists wrong before -- and we will do it again.
p290
aV(Applause.)
p291
aVA hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law.
p292
aVThe Supreme Court now has two superb new members -- new members on its bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito.
p293
aV(Applause.)
p294
aVI thank the Senate for confirming both of them.
p295
aVI will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law, and not legislate from the bench.
p296
aV(Applause.)
p297
aVToday marks the official retirement of a very special American.
p298
aVFor 24 years of faithful service to our nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
p299
aV(Applause.)
p300
aVA hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of every life.
p301
aVTonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms, creating or implanting embryos for experiments, creating human-animal hybrids, and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos.
p302
aVHuman life is a gift from our Creator -- and that gift should never be discarded, devalued or put up for sale.
p303
aV(Applause.)
p304
aVA hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.
p305
aV(Applause.)
p306
aVHonorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington -- I support your efforts.
p307
aVEach of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility -- and that is a pledge we must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.
p308
aV(Applause.)
p309
aVAs we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one another.
p310
aVA hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love.
p311
aVThrough the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child -- and this good work is being led by our First Lady, Laura Bush.
p312
aV(Applause.)
p313
aVThis year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school, so more of America's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams.
p314
aVA hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency -- and stays at it until they're back on their feet.
p315
aVSo far the federal government has committed $85 billion to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans.
p316
aVWe're removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees.
p317
aVWe're providing business loans and housing assistance.
p318
aVYet as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived.
p319
aVIn New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country.
p320
aVThe answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and more opportunities to own a home and start a business.
p321
aVAs we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity.
p322
aV(Applause.)
p323
aVA hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be prevented, and treated, and defeated.
p324
aVMore than a million Americans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans.
p325
aVI ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act, and provide new funding to states, so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America.
p326
aV(Applause.)
p327
aVWe will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African American churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in America.
p328
aV(Applause.)
p329
aVFellow citizens, we've been called to leadership in a period of consequence.
p330
aVWe've entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite.
p331
aVWe see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives.
p332
aVSometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore.
p333
aVYet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing.
p334
aVLincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery.
p335
aVMartin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma, and achieved only half a victory over segregation.
p336
aVThe United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe, and been complicit in the oppression of others.
p337
aVToday, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back, or finish well?
p338
aVBefore history is written down in books, it is written in courage.
p339
aVLike Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well.
p340
aVWe will lead freedom's advance.
p341
aVWe will compete and excel in the global economy.
p342
aVWe will renew the defining moral commitments of this land.
p343
aVAnd so we move forward -- optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of the victories to come.
p344
aVMay God bless America.
p345
aV(Applause.)
