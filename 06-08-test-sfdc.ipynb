My apologies for the inconvenience. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have checked our expense database and confirmed that the error found in our logs is error 507. This means that Chase J.P.Morgan Commercial Card is still a beta site and is not yet in production. It is still a beta site work in progress and there is no estimated time provided as to when sync will be successful. Please try again later. \\r\\n\\r\\nYodlee has provided us a list of supported sites and https://smartdata.jpmorgan.com/sdportal/dashboard.view?request.trail.token.key=3db160e6cd9f87011926912f330f151b isn't included. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, your employees may manually enter their card expenses to Concur. \\r\\n\\r\\nShould you need further assistance in this case, I have set the case in Pending Client Confirmation. This case remains open for 10 days and will automatically close after 10 days of no response. When this happens, please contact Support or open a new case. Thank you and have a nice day. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nBest Regards,\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny Virrey\\r\\nGlobal Service & Support\"),\n",

       "               u\"Hi Denise,\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for your response. The specific concern raised in this case is about being unable to sync Chase J.P.Morgan Commercial Card to Concur via Yodlee. Yodlee doesn't currently support  the url (https://smartdata.jpmorgan.com/sdportal/dashboard.view?request.trail.token.key=3db160e6cd9f87011926912f330f151b). Hence, sync is not successful.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen JP Morgan informed you that smart data should sync with Concur, JP Morgan must be referring to the corporate credit card feed setup in Concur. With a corporate credit card feed, the corporate credit card transactions of employees are directly sent to us by the bank. If you choose to setup a corporate credit card feed to import your employees credit card transactions to Concur, you may want to discuss this with your Account Manager or your Implementation Consultant.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease let me know if you have further questions or concerns with regards to this case. I have set the case in Pending Client Confirmation. This case remains open for 10 days and will automatically close after 10 days of no response. When this happens,  please contact Support or open a new case. Thank you and have a nice day. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBest Regards,\\r\\n\\r\\nJenny Virrey\\r\\nGlobal Service & Support\"),\n",
